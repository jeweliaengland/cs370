Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This course was one of my favorite courses that I have taken so far. I loved learning about Artificial intelleghence and how it works in various codes. In this project, we were given code for a pirate maze game. I had to fill in the code to make it so the pirate could use AI and get to the other side of the maze quickly. 
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist are expected to have a wide range of skills and knowledge in the field. They develop, test, design, etc with industry best practices. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Over the course of the last couple years, I have learned how hard and frustrating computer science can be. Something that has helped me is taking a step back from my work and coming back to it with a fresh pair of eyes a few years later. 
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical resposibilities are to ensure that the end user gets a fully functional cide. This code must ensure their privacy and security. It also must be honest.
